    This is a simple baseline model which uses the last observation as the mean of a predictive negative binomial distribution. The dispersion paramter is estimated from the last 5 observations.

    This is a simple baseline model which uses the last observation as the mean of
    a predictive negative binomial distribution. The dispersion paramter is estimated
    from the last 5 observations (using maximum likelihood and the respective preceding
    observations as conditional means).
