team_model_designation: primary
data_inputs: ECDC, confirmed cases, reported fatalities, population
methods: This model makes predictions about the future, unconditional on particular intervention strategies.
    Statistical dynamical growth model accounting for population susceptibility. 
    Uses Search-and-Matching Markov-Model.
methods_long: We model the evolution of the number of individuals that are reported to be sick with
COVID-19 in Germany. Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov
chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after
infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number
of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals
following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to
study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without
public regulation of social contacts.
