data_inputs: RKI/ECDC, DIVI, reported deaths, ICU and ventilation data
methods: This is a simple time series forecast which serves as a non-naive baseline. The forecast comes from an exponential smoothing model fitted to the most recent twelve weeks of data. Forecasts are obtained using the R function forecast::ets with setting model="MMN". This approach is taken from Petropolous and Makridakis (2020): Forecasting the novel coronavirus COVID-19, Plos One.
