# Contents

The file `truth_cum_deaths.csv` contains daily time series of cumulative COVID19 death counts at the Bundesland and national level (by reporting date). The file `truth_inc_deaths.csv` contains the correponding time series of incident deaths. In both, the `date`variable corresponds to the date of reporting, as is the case for the ECDC data provided in `data-truth/ECDC` (indeed, when summed over all Bundesl√§nder, the data provided here agree almost perfectly with the ECDC data).

# Data Source

The presented counts are updated each day based on [data made available by RKI](https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dd4580c810204019a7b8eb3e0b329dd6_0) (taking the difference between values from the previous day and the new values). The `date` variable consequently refers to the reporting date. For historic data until 2020-06-24 we aggregated the data collected in https://github.com/ard-data/2020-rki-archive/tree/master/data/2_parsed (see license file). From 2020-06-25 onwards we download the data directly from the RKI/arcgis platform.

# Data Aggregation
