    This is a simple quantile-wise average of other models submitted to the Forecast Hub.

    This is a simple quantile-wise average of other models submitted to the Forecast Hub. We account for
    use of different truth data by different models, aligning all forecasts of cumulative deaths with the
    last observed value from the ECDC data.
    To assess the performance of ensemble forecast we added ensemble forecasts retrospectively for weeks 
    prior to 2020-08-17 in September 2020. This is documented in code/validation/commit_dates.csv.
    From 2020-09-21 onwards, our main ensemble is the median ensemble as it showed better overall performance.
    We keep producing the mean ensemble to monitor its performance.
