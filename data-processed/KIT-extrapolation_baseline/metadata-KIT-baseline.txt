data_inputs: RKI/ECDC, DIVI, reported deaths, ICU and ventilation data
methods: This is a simple multiplicative extrapolation baseline model. The dispersion paramter is estimated from the last 5 observations.
methods_long: This is a simple baseline model which uses a multiplicative interpolation of the last two 
    observations as the mean of a predictive negative binomial distribution. The dispersion paramter is estimated
    from the last 5 observations (using maximum likelihood; excludig the last observation as by construction it agrees 
    with its conditional expectation).
