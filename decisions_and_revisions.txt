Documentation of revisions to forecasts

This file was created at the staart of the pre-specified evaluation period on 14 Oct 2020.

### Documentation of decisions on ensemble:

Tue 11 Oct: LeipzigIMISE-SECIR omitted from ensembles due to extremely low forecast uncertainty.
Wed 21 Oct: LeipzigIMISE-SECIR omitted from ensembles as PR accidentially did not contain required files. MIT_CovidAnalytics-Delphi omitted from all Poland ensembles as we believe there was a technical error (all numbers considerably too low). MIT_CovidAnalytics-Delphi was kept in Germany ensembles, though. KIT-baseline was removed from all ensembles as we consider the last-observation-carried-forward approach inappropriate in the current phase. MOCOS model omitted from all ensembles as only one- and two week ahead forecasts were available.
Tue 27 Oct: LeipzigIMISE-SECIR and ITWW-county_repro omitted from ensembles due to extremely low forecast uncertainty. LANL-growthRate omitted from Germany ensembles due to unrealistically low forecasts.
Tue 4 Nov: LANL omitted from ensemble as last available forecast dated from Wed 28 Oct. KIT-time_series_baseline omitted due to excessively wide uncertainty bands.
Wed 11 Nov: Ensemble only created on Wednesday to be able to include MOCOS forecasts. MIT cumulative forecasts excluded as much too sharp relative to incidence forecasts. ICM forecast not included as forecasts seem shifted by one week. LeipzigIMISE forecasts excluded due to missingness of quantiles for incident forecasts and unlikely non-monotonic pattern over next four weeks.
Tue 1 Dec: ITWW not included in deaths, Germany due to strong misalignment with past values. KIT-time_series_baseline excluded due to unrealistically large values for several quantities.
Tue 8 Dec: KIT-time_series_baseline excluded from death forecasts due to unplausible behaviour. ICM model excluded due to very pronounced divergence from other models.

### Documentation of forecast revisions:

Wed 14 Oct: revision of cumulative case and death forecasts in epiforecasts-EpiNow2. These were obviously subject to a technical error (exported last observed cumulative + incident from respective week rather than cumulative sum).
Wed 14 Oct: revision of ensembles to include corrected epiforecasts-EpiNow2 preditions
Wed 14 Oct: adding Saxony forecasts to LeipzigIMISE-SECIR. These had been submitted in a separate file on Tuesday.
Fri 16 Oct: MIT model had been accidentially omitted from 2020-10-12 "inc death ensembles". Correcting these files.
Tue 20 Oct: ITTW revised forecasts for Polish voivodeships from 2020-10-12. This was necessary as the truth data made available in the Forecast Hub repository had been erroneous.
Wed 21 Oct: Retrospectively added KIT-time_ series_baseline model (exponential smoothing)
Fri 23 Oct: Temporally removing MIT Covid Analytics forecasts for Poland, 19 Oct. These were likely subject to a technical problem. The handling of these forecasts for evaluation remains to be determined.
Tue 27 Oct: Retrospectively adding UCLA forecasts from 4, 11, 18 Oct. which had appeared online with a delay
Wed 28 Oct: ICM model submitted late on Tuesday evening included (as specified in protocol)
Wed 28 Oct: MOCOC team provided three and four week ahead forecasts from last week which had been missing due to problems writing out the results of their model. These have been included, but this will be mentioned in a footnote in the respective summaries. Added UCLA forecast from 26 Oct which had appeared online ~Tuesday 5pm.
Mon 2 Nov: Set ITTW Poland foecasts from 12 Oct back to original version. These had accidentially been revised on 20 Oct (only forecasts for voivodeships should have been revised).
Mon 2 Nov: Removed all-zero forecasts by USC from 26 Oct. For Germany national level replaced by forecasts from respective "global" (instead of "other") file.
Tue 23 Nov: MOCOS forecast arrived slightly late, but delay had been communicated in advance.
Wed 4 Nov: Retrospectively added inverse WIS ensemble for first four weeks. This had not been operational before. The implementation, however, follows strictly the one described in the pre-registration.
Fri 6 Nov: Added simple baseline which had been forgotten this week (unproblematic as no tuning involved).
Sun 8 Nov: Adding case forecasts for Geneva which had not been extracted for certain weeks. These are not delayed forecasts, but just files we overlooked when the Geneva team published them on their website.
Tue 10 Nov: Added LANL forecasts from 1 Nov that haven't been available on 3 Nov
Wed 18 Nov: Leipzig IMISE forecast added late.
Tue 24 Nov: Leipzig IMISE forecast added only after ensemble creation (ca 18:00).
Wed 25 Nov: Adding MIMUW forecasts late.
Wed 25 Nov: Removing ITWW from Germany case ensemble due to implausibly high values (overlooked yesterday).
Wed 2 Dec: MIMUW forecast added late.
Wed 2 Dec: Adding FIAS/FZJ and Leipzig forecasts back into Germany/deaths ensemble after FIAS/FZJ team confirmed that forecast was considered sound. Also adding Leipzig to incident cases from which it had been missing accidentially. Time series baseline removed as values unrealistically large for some quantities.
Wed 2 Dec: Revised extraction scripts for USC. Now always using JHU-based forecasts also shown in USC dashboard at national level. Using the ECDC-based forecasts only at Bundesland level as they are not always available.
Tue 8 Dec: MOCOS model arrived late (~18:45)
