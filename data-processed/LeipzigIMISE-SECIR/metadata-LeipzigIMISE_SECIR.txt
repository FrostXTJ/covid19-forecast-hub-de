data_inputs: RKI and DIVI, ECDC, age distributions for cases and deaths from RKI as described in methods, case & ICU  & death counts
methods: SECIR type model 
methods_long: 
	2021-03-15 - present		Including increasing percentage of more infective variant B.1.1.7
	2021-03-15 - present		Improving transformation daily-weekly inc predictions
	2021-03-01 - present		Accounting for higher infectivity for a second mutanted virus by adding additionals compartments in the SECIR model for Saxony (not for Germany, yet)
	2020-11-17 - 2021-02-24		BUG in cumulative weekly data present. Submissions in this time-period may sometimes be considerably too low compared with submitted weekly incident data. Bug occurred 	
								when transforming the daily data from the model to weekly cumulative data. Submitted weekly incident predictions are not affected. Weekly cumulative predictions remain in the repo. Submitted daily predictions from this period are also affected as submitted daily predictions are intermediate values from the transforming of the originally daily forecasts to the cumulative weekly forecasts. As daily predictions of test-positives and died persons are not used in the preregistered evaluation period, they will be removed from the repo. Daily and weekly ICU predictions are not affected and will also remain in the repo.
	2021-02-08 - present		Using more liberal definition for future uncertainty of infectivity based on past variance learned from data
	2021-02-08 - 2021-02-08		Used for Saxony forecast from 2021-02-01
	2021-01-18 - 2021-01-31		Germany only: Assuming average reduction in infectivity of 40% (i.e. infectivity level 60% compared with infectivity seen in beginn of December) and assuming variance infectivity +- 20% to reflect uncertainty, Saxony done standard
	2021-01-11 - present		Stronger regularisation of future infectivity by using stronger priors
	2020-12-28 - 2021-01-03		Assuming average reduction in infectivity of 40% (i.e. infectivity level 60% compared with infectivity seen in beginn of December) and assuming variance infectivity +- 20% to reflect uncertainty
	2020-12-21 - 2020-12-21		Assuming average reduction in infectivity of 20% (i.e. infectivity level 80% compared with infectivity seen in beginn of December) and assuming variance infectivity +- 20% to reflect uncertainty
	2020-12-14 - 2020-12-20		Assuming average reduction in infectivity of 20% (i.e. infectivity level 80% compared with infectivity seen in beginn of December)
	2020-11-30 - present		Longer MCMC Chains to better explore parameter space
	2020-11-30 - present		Prior for mean of time-dependent variables last estimated value instead of mean of last four
	2020-11-23 - present 		Simple adjustment of near-future-predictions by vertically shifting prediction of day/week zero to last observed value at day zero  
	2020-11-16 - present		Quantifying variance from 	time-dependent death rate / time-dependent weekly ICU rate estimation into uncertainty of forecast
	2020-11-02 - 2020-11-22		Infectivity simulated based on multiple scenarios of different lockdown-efficiencies, 2020-11-02 -2020-11-15 four scenarious integrated in a single forecast, 2020-11-16 2020-11-16 one scenario integrated
	2020-09-22 - present		Allowing influx of compartment death from cases directly in addition to influx from compartment icu
	2020-09-14 - present	 	Input ECDC Data, including case and ICU predictions, using incident data for cumulative prediction instead of providing directly results from independent cumulative fit as done previously
	2020-07-21 - present	 	instead of using age structure for death prediction using empirical time-dependent death rate / time-dependent weekly ICU rate
	2020-07-14 - 2020-07-20 	additionally including age structure for deaths
	2020-06-22 - 2020-09-21	  	Input RKI Data instead of ECDC data, output accounts for reporting delays and is compatible with EDCDC data.
    2020-06-15 - 2020-06-21  	Input ECDC Data
	
	Open ISSUES: Quantile for weekly incident forecast, constrain lower estimate of cumulative counts to last empirical value
	More Details TBD
