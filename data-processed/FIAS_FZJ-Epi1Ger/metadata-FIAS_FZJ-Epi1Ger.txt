    An extended SEIR model with additional compartments for undetected cases is fit
    using multiple segments to the available data for reported cases and then to reported
    deaths. The parametrization of the last fit is used to forecast incidental and cumulative
    deaths. Confidence intervals are determined using Monte Carlo sampling of the parameter space.
