These data are pulled on a daily basis from [this Google Sheet](bit.ly/covid19-poland). It aggregates Polish COVID19 data from the [Polish Ministry of Health](https://www.gov.pl/web/zdrowie) in an easily readable format and is run by [Michal Rogalski](https://twitter.com/micalrg).

Note that we shift these data by one say so that they agree with the time scale of the ECDC data (e.g., data entered for 2020-09-26 in our csv file is entered as 2020-09-25 in Michal's Google Sheet). This is done to ensure coherence between the different data provided in our repository.
