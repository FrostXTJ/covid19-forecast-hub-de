	2020-09-22 - present 		Allowing influx of compartment death from cases directly in addition to influx from compartment icu
	2020-09-14 - 2020-09-21 	Input ECDC Data, including case and ICU predictions, using incident data for cumulative prediction instead of providing an independent cumulative fit as done previously
	2020-07-21 - 2020-09-14 	instead of using age structure for death prediction using empirical weekly death rate / weekly ICU rate
	2020-07-14 - 2020-07-20 	additionally including age structure for deaths
	2020-06-22 - 2020-07-13  	Input RKI Data instead of ECDC data, output accounts for reporting delays and is compatible with EDCDC data.
    2020-06-15 - 2020-06-21  	Input ECDC Data
	
	Open ISSUES: Quantile for weekly incident forecast, constrain lower estimate of cumulative counts to last empirical value
	More Details TBD
