Documentation of revisions to forecasts

This file was created at the staart of the pre-specified evaluation period on 14 Oct 2020.

### Documentation of decisions on ensemble:

Tue 11 Oct: LeipzigIMISE-SECIR omitted from ensembles due to extremely low forecast uncertainty.
Wed 21 Oct: LeipzigIMISE-SECIR omitted from ensembles as PR accidentially did not contain required files. MIT_CovidAnalytics-Delphi omitted from all Poland ensembles as we believe there was a technical error (all numbers considerably too low). MIT_CovidAnalytics-Delphi was kept in Germany ensembles, though. KIT-baseline was removed from all ensembles as we consider the last-observation-carried-forward approach inappropriate in the current phase. MOCOS model omitted from all ensembles as only one- and two week ahead forecasts were available.

### Documentation of forecast revisions:

Wed 14 Oct: revision of cumulative case and death forecasts in epiforecasts-EpiNow2. These were obviously subject to a technical error (exported last observed cumulative + incident from respective week rather than cumulative sum).
Wed 14 Oct: revision of ensembles to include corrected epiforecasts-EpiNow2 preditions
Wed 14 Oct: adding Saxony forecasts to LeipzigIMISE-SECIR. These had been submitted in a separate file on Tuesday.
Fri 16 Oct: MIT model had been accidentially omitted from 2020-10-12 "inc death ensembles". Correcting these files.
Tue 20 Oct: ITTW revised forecasts for Polish voivodeships from 2020-10-12. This was necessary as the truth data made available in the Forecast Hub repository had been erroneous.
Wed 21 Oct: Retrospectively added KIT-time_ series_baseline model (exponential smoothing)
Fri 23 Oct: Temporally removing MIT Covid Analytics forecasts for Poland, 19 Oct. These were likely subject to a technical problem. The handling of these forecasts for evaluation remains to be determined.
Tue 27 Oct: Retrospectively adding UCLA forecasts from 4, 11, 18 Oct. which had appeared online with a delay
