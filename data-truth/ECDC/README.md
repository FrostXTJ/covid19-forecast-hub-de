The files `truth_ECDC-Incident Deaths_Germany.csv` contains the time series of incident COVID19 deaths in Germany (by reporting date) according to [ECDC data](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide). `truth_ECDC-Cumulative Deaths_Germany.csv` contains the corresponding time series of cumulative counts. Note that in the folder `data-truth/RKI` we provide corresponding data at the Bundesland level.

The ECDC data currently represents our preferred truth data source, even though we also include forecasts that refer to the JHU data (see `data-truth/JHU`).
