data_inputs: ECDC, confirmed cases, reported fatalities
methods: Update 2020-10-08: "We model the number of cases and deaths using an ensemble model which compared a set of candidate models each day. The best model is picked using a cross validation procedure."
    "We calculate the growth rate of cumulative cases (resp. deaths) between two days ago and today. 
    If it's greater than 5%, we use an exponential model to forecast the cumulative number of cases (resp. deaths), 
    and then derive the daily number of cases (resp. deaths). If it's less than 5%, we use an linear model instead."
